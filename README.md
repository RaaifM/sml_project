# sml_project
Statistical &amp; Machine learning project for the course 2095. 

1) We consider flights that are cancelled, diverted, and arrival daly > 15 as being a delayed flight (1: delayed, 0: not delayed)
2) We drop all columns that are redundent and/or include post event information. So we only use data that can be observed before the flights takes-off.
